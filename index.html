            <h2>INTRODUCING <strong>ME</strong></h2>

            <p>Tracy Antoinette Sonyah is my name, I'm a young Developer, an aspiring one, who loves her field of study. Becoming the best Software Engineer the World has ever seen is one of my
                many goals in life. The goal is to work at a FAANG Company, Apple preferably but a big company. I'm willing to do any and everything in my power to reach where i wanna be.
            </p>

            <p>I love coding, i feel this is a job for me considering the fact that i'm an intoverted person. What's more beautiful than sitting at home relaxingly working(coding doesn't even feel like work only when u have deadline.) on your computer on your computer, and to
                make it more interesting, add a rain to the day and u get an awesome time spent alone. One important lesson in life to know is that you get what you put in and maybe it's cause i wanna fill this up with texts that's why i'm saying all this but you get the point. Okay love yourself, keep doing what you're doing, KEEP CODING, and THIS IS MY PORTFOLIO IN 30MINS, THANK YOU!
